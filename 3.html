      <h2>Rochester Model</h2>
      <img src="ratinal model.jpg" width='10%'>
      <p>Our main thesis is that parties in democratic politics are analogous to entrepreneurs in a profit-seeking economy. So as, to attain their private ends, they formulate whatever policies they believe will gain the most votes, just as entrepreneurs produce whatever products they believe will gain the most profits for the same reason. In order to examine the implications of this thesis, <strong>we have assumed that citizens behave rationally in politics.</strong> This premise is itself a second major hypothesis.
      <br><br>
      This follows from <strong>the definition of rational as efficient, i.e., maximizing output for a given input, or minimizing input for a given output.</strong> Thus, whenever economists refer to a ’rational man’ they are not designating a man whose thought processes consist exclusively of logical propositions, or a man without prejudices, or a man whose emotions are incorporative. In normal usage all of these could be considered rational men. But the economic definition refers solely to a man who moves toward his goals in a way which, to the best of his knowledge, uses the least possible input of scarce resources per unit of valued output.</p>
