      <p>The modern history of academic voting research began in 1940 at Columbia University, where a team of social scientists assembled by Paul Lazarsfeld pioneered the application of survey research to the study of electoral behavior. As occasionally happens with major innovations, this pioneering effort seems even in the light of subsequent advances to have been remarkably sophisticated. Lazarsfeld and his colleagues surveyed 600 prospective voters in a single community (Erie County, Ohio) as many as seven times over the course of the 1940 presidential campaign, with a complex mixture of new and repeated questions in each successive interview, and with additional fresh cross-sections to serve as baselines for assessing the effects of repeated interviewing on the respondents in the main panel.

      Given their interests and study design, the Columbia researchers must have been surprised by what they found. Their careful measurement of media content turned out to be of little use in accounting for voters’ choices most of which seemed to be based upon strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_loyalty" target="_blank" title="specification">“brand loyalties”</a> rooted in religion and social class and reinforced by faceto-face interactions with like-minded acquaintances. Their lavish panel design revealed a good deal of reinforcement of pre-existing political predispositions, but rather little outright conversion. Thus, by the time of their 1948 study, Lazarsfeld and his colleagues were downplaying the role of the parties and the mass media and elaborating their analysis of interpersonal <strong>influence by measuring respondents’ perceptions of the political views of their <u>families, friends, and co-workers,</u> emphasizing the homogeneity of these social networks and their tendency to produce increasing political conformity over the course of the campaign.</strong>
