      <p>Scholarly studies of electoral behavior have a long and vibrant history. My aim here is to provide a selective summary of that history, focusing on developments that seem to me to have been especially important in shaping the current contours of the field.1 Since new preoccupations and insights have usually emerged as responses to salient past successes and failures, the organization of my survey is largely (though not entirely) chronological.
      <br><br>
      I have, of course, ignored many important contributions and elided many relevant details. That is inevitable, given limitations of space and of my own expertise. Fortunately, much of what is missing here is handsomely addressed in other chapters of this volume. In any event, my hope is that the range of scholarship touched upon in the following pages will provide some sense of the richness and significance of what has been accomplished by scholars of electoral behavior over the past 70 years, while also inspiring the scholars who chart the mainstream of electoral research in the future to tackle some of the many fundamental issues that remain unresolved.</p>
